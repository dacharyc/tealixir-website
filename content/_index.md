{{< problem-solution title="The Problem We Solve" >}}
**Tired of buying tea you don't like?** We've all been there – standing in the tea aisle, trying to remember if that Earl Grey was amazing or awful. Or discovering a perfect tea at a friend's house but forgetting the brand by the time you get to the store.

**Other tea apps are just digital notebooks.** They make you type everything manually, can't understand tea packaging, and don't help you make better buying decisions.

**TeaLixir is different.** It's the first tea app built by tea lovers, for tea lovers, with intelligence that actually helps.
