# The TeaLixir App

Dachary Carey built the TeaLixir App. This SERVICE is provided by Dachary Carey and is intended for use as-is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decides to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use

The TeaLixir App saves your tea tracking data including tea information, ratings, tasting notes, photos, and brewing instructions to Apple iCloud. This data is stored securely in your personal iCloud account and never leaves your control. I never have access to your tea data, and do not attempt to collect any data for personal use.

The TeaLixir App may use device capabilities such as the camera to help you photograph tea packages for easier data entry. Photos are processed locally on your device and only saved to your iCloud account if you choose to include them with your tea records.

## Log Data

If you request support for a bug, I may ask for details about your app usage or Log Data from your device to help me reproduce and diagnose the bug. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics. TeaLixir does not otherwise log any data.

## Cookies

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

Neither the TeaLixir App nor the TeaLixir Website uses these "cookies".

## Service Providers

I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

*   To facilitate our Service;
*   To provide the Service on our behalf;
*   To perform Service-related services; or
*   To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.

I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties may have access to personal data. Third-party services may use analytics to collect usage about their product. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

Currently, the third-party services used in this app include:

* Apple iCloud (for secure data storage)
* Apple Core ML (for on-device image processing)

I do not have access to any of this data.

## Security

I value your trust in using our Service, thus I strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. Your tea data is stored securely in your personal Apple iCloud account using Apple's industry-standard encryption. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Children's Privacy

I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. I encourage all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. I encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to us through the Application and/or Services, please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of 2025-12-07
