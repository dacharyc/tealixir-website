# The TeaLixir App

Dachary Carey built the TeaLixir App. This SERVICE is provided by Dachary Carey and is intended for use as-is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decides to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use

### Data Storage and iCloud Integration

TeaLixir is designed with privacy as a core principle. All your tea tracking data is stored exclusively in your personal Apple iCloud account, which means:

**What Data is Stored:**
- Tea information (name, type, origin, brand, etc.)
- Your personal ratings and tasting notes
- Brewing instructions and preferences
- Photos of tea packages (if you choose to add them)
- Purchase tracking and tea collection history
- Your personal tea preference analysis

**How iCloud Storage Works:**
- All data is stored directly in your personal iCloud account using Apple's CloudKit framework
- Data is encrypted both in transit and at rest using Apple's industry-standard encryption
- Your data syncs automatically across all your Apple devices signed into the same iCloud account
- You maintain complete ownership and control of your data at all times

**Privacy Guarantees:**
- **I never have access to your tea data** - it's stored exclusively in your iCloud account
- **No data collection** - TeaLixir does not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal information on external servers
- **No analytics or tracking** - the app does not track your usage or send any data to third parties
- **Offline functionality** - the app works completely offline; internet connection is only needed for iCloud sync

**Your Control:**
- You can disable iCloud sync in your device settings if you prefer local-only storage
- You can delete all your data by removing the app and clearing TeaLixir data from your iCloud settings
- Your data remains private to you and is governed by Apple's iCloud Privacy Policy

### Camera and Image Processing

The TeaLixir App uses your device's camera to help you photograph tea packages for easier data entry through our smart scanning feature:

- **Local Processing Only:** All image recognition and text extraction (OCR) happens locally on your device using Apple's Core ML framework
- **No Image Upload:** Photos are never uploaded to external servers or transmitted over the internet
- **Your Choice:** Photos are only saved to your iCloud account if you explicitly choose to include them with your tea records
- **Privacy Focused:** Even when saved, photos remain in your personal iCloud storage and are never accessible to me or any third parties

## Log Data

If you request support for a bug, I may ask for details about your app usage or Log Data from your device to help me reproduce and diagnose the bug. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics. TeaLixir does not otherwise log any data.

## Cookies

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

Neither the TeaLixir App nor the TeaLixir Website uses these "cookies".

## Service Providers

TeaLixir uses Apple's services to provide core functionality while maintaining your privacy:

- **Privacy:** Your data is governed by Apple's iCloud Privacy Policy and Apple's commitment to user privacy
- **Control:** You can manage your iCloud storage and delete TeaLixir data through your Apple ID settings

### Apple Core ML
- **Purpose:** On-device machine learning for tea package scanning and text recognition
- **Data Processing:** All image analysis happens locally on your device - no data is sent to Apple or any external servers
- **Privacy:** Images and extracted text never leave your device during processing

### Important Privacy Notes:
- **No Third-Party Analytics:** TeaLixir does not use any analytics services, crash reporting tools, or advertising networks
- **No Data Sharing:** Your tea data is never shared with any third parties, including myself as the developer
- **Apple's Privacy Standards:** All Apple services used by TeaLixir adhere to Apple's strict privacy guidelines and policies

## Security

I value your trust in using TeaLixir and have designed the app with security and privacy as fundamental principles.

- Regular security audits and compliance certifications
- Physical security measures protect the hardware storing your data

### App-Level Security

**Local Device Security:**

**No External Vulnerabilities:**

- No user accounts or passwords to manage or potentially compromise
- No web-based interfaces that could be vulnerable to common web attacks

- No method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure
