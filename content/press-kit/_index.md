## Key Features

### Smart Tea Scanning
TeaLixir's text recognition reads tea packaging and automatically extracts comprehensive information without manual typing.

- **Automatic Data Extraction**: Scan tea packages to capture name, brand, origin, estate, tea type, caffeine level, flush season, harvest details, and brewing instructions
- **Tea-Aware Parsing**: Understands tea terminology and relationships (e.g., "Ceylon" means Sri Lanka, recognizes estate names)
- **Multi-Angle Scanning**: Capture multiple sides of packaging for complete information extraction
- **Brand Matching**: Automatically links teas to existing brands in your collection

### Detailed Preparation Logging
Track different preparations, represented as "cups," to build a comprehensive taste profile. You might love a tea iced with mint but dislike it hot with honey - TeaLixir helps you remember these preferences.

- **Per-Cup Ratings**: Rate each cup individually (1-5 stars) rather than rating the tea as a whole
- **Preparation Tracking**: Record hot vs. iced preparation methods
- **Addition Management**: Track honey, milk, sugar, and custom additions with preference scoring
- **Tasting Notes**: Select from comprehensive tasting note library organized by category

## About the Developer

Dachary Carey is a technical writer and indie developer who creates apps to solve real-world problems.

TeaLixir was born from watching her wife's frustration in tea aisles, trying to remember whether a particular Earl Grey was amazing or awful, and discovering perfect teas at friends' houses only to forget the brand by the time they reached the store.

Her approach to app development focuses on understanding the real problems users face and building intelligent solutions that respect user privacy and data ownership. TeaLixir represents this philosophy - it's not just a digital notebook, but an intelligent companion that grows smarter as you use it.
